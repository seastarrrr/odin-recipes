        <h2>Ingredience</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose flour</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon baking powder</li>
                <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons granulated sugar</li>
                <li>1 cup soy milk</li>
                <li>1/2 cup water</li>
                <li>2 tablespoons canola oil</li>
            </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>In a large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, 
                    salt and sugar.</li>
                <li>Pour the milk, water and oil into the bowl with the dry i
                    ngredients, and stir with a large spoon until just combined.
                    A few lumps are okay; do not over mix or your pancakes 
                    won't be as fluffy.</li>
                <li>Heat a large griddle or pan over medium-high heat. Grease 
                    the pan with vegan butter or coconut oil, and drop about 
                    1/3 cup of the batter onto it. Cook until bubbles form, 
                    then flip and cook until golden brown on the other side, 
                    about 1-2 minutes. Repeat with all the remaining batter.
                </li>
                <li>Serve with vegan butter, pure maple syrup and perhaps some 
                    fresh fruit.</li>
            </ol>
